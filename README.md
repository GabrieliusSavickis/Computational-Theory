# Countdown Numbers Game Solver

This repository hosts a Python solution designed to solve the Countdown Numbers Game, a challenging segment from the TV show Countdown. Our solver tackles the computational intricacies involved in deriving either exact or approximate solutions using a set of numbers and arithmetic operations.

## Project Description

In the Countdown Numbers Game, contestants use six randomly chosen numbers and arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to hit a randomly generated target number. The game tests the optimization of operation sequences and the efficiency of problem-solving under tight constraints.

## Features

- **Solver Algorithm**: Employs both brute-force and heuristic methods to discover possible solutions.
- **Optimization Analysis**: Analyzes computational complexity and explores strategies to optimize the solving process.
- **Educational Tool**: Acts as a learning aid for understanding computational paradigms and algorithm design.
